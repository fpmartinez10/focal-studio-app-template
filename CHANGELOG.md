## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Multi-agent architecture: five specialist subagents (`ios-frontend`, `backend-integrator`, `release-manager`, `aso-marketing`, `qa-reviewer`) all in `.claude/agents/`, coordinated by the main Opus session — every fork inherits them with no per-machine install
- Vendored skill packs under `.claude/skills/`: frontend (`frontend_design`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `design-for-ai`), React Native (`rn-*` bundle from gigs-slc), backend (`react-native-expert`, `typescript-pro`), copywriting (`ralph-copywriter`), security (`tob-*` from Trail of Bits), and custom `expo-services` + `aso-rules` skills
- `AGENTS.md` at repo root — short entry-point doc (compulsory pre-work, repo map, agent registry, top mistakes) for any agent or human starting work
- New "Multi-agent workflow" section in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` describing orchestration playbook
- Rewrote `.claude/SKILLS.md` as an agent → skills matrix

### Changed
- `.gitignore` no longer ignores `.claude/skills/` — vendored skills now ship with the template
- Granted `Write` to `qa-reviewer` and `release-manager` so they can honor the long-report disk-handoff convention; scope is restricted to `.claude/scratch/` reports — they still must not modify project source
- Multi-agent workflow now uses a disk-handoff convention for long subagent reports (>~80 lines): the subagent writes the full report to `.claude/scratch/<agent>-<ts>.md` and returns only the path plus a 3-bullet summary. Keeps the orchestrator context lean during mixed/parallel runs. `.claude/scratch/` is gitignored.
